# ling073-ton-corpus
Initial corpus assembly for Tongan.

Note 2/2/17:

Raw corpus data saved in 'ton.tales.collocott.txt' does not have the same exact orthography as the other sources. It is missing the macron, which is a very common diacritic used in Tongan. This issue will need to be resolved in future work. 

'ton.bible.worldbibles.txt' contains text from Genesis 1:1 - however more data from this Tongan bible can be aquired. I chose to only include this passage in ton.basic.corpus.txt because I wanted to be sure to include a variety of corpus data.
